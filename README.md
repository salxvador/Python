# Python Projects
## Introduction
These are basic projects written in Python. They use various modules such as tkinter, or sqlite3. The most recent additions to this repo use the Django web development framework.

_Following this course, I participated in a 2 week live project designed to simulate a single sprint in a real working development environment. You can read more about that [here](https://github.com/salxvador/PythonProjects/blob/main/LiveProject.md)._

## Projects

### [Check Files GUI](https://github.com/salxvador/PythonProjects/blob/main/FileTransferSubmission.py):
This project allows the user to transfer all .txt files from one chosen directory to another.

### [Django Checkbook Balancer](https://github.com/salxvador/PythonProjects/tree/main/Django_Checkbook):
This project functions as a web-based bank account balancer. It allows the user to set up new profiles with initial deposit amounts, add new deposit/withdrawal transactions, and track historical activity for a given account.
